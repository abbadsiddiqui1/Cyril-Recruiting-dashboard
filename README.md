# CyrilHQ — Your Personal Command Center

> Built by [Cyril Annoh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cyril-annoh/) · If you use this, tag me on LinkedIn for credit 🙏

This was created to help students with summer recruitment prep instead of having to do it all in an Excel spreadsheet.

A full-stack personal dashboard for CS students in internship recruiting season.
Built for my own Summer 2027 recruiting grind — feel free to fork and make it yours.

## Features
- 🎯 **Career Tracker** — 100 companies pre-loaded, track Applied/OA/Interview/Result, add new companies, opening date countdown
- 💻 **NeetCode 150 Tracker** — Track all 150 NeetCode problems, mark mastered/in progress, add pattern notes
- 📝 **Notes** — Capture DSA patterns, ideas, follow-ups by tag
- 🔗 **Links** — Save important career/DSA/project links
- 🌡️ **Mood Tracker** — Daily check-ins
- 🔔 **Reminders** — Send yourself rich HTML email reminders, schedule future ones
- 📧 **Auto Emails** — Daily NeetCode reminder (9am ET) + Weekly digest (Monday 8am ET)

## Screenshots

## What this isn't
This is a personal tool, not a SaaS product. There's no multi-user login, no real database (everything lives in your browser's localStorage), and email scheduling is in-memory (resets if the backend restarts). If you want something more robust, fork it and build on top — that's the whole point.

## No Java or Spring Boot experience?
Don't let that stop you. Use AI (Claude, ChatGPT, whatever you've got) to help you read through the code and get it running — the codebase is pretty straightforward and well-commented. And if you genuinely get stuck, feel free to message me directly. I'd rather help you fix it than have you give up on it.

**Good luck on your SWE search.**

## Personalize It First (Manual Steps)

Before running, update these to match your info:

**1. Your email** — search and replace `cyrrilann@gmail.com` with your own email across:
- `backend/src/main/java/com/dashboard/controller/ReminderController.java`
- `backend/src/main/java/com/dashboard/scheduler/WeeklyDigestScheduler.java`
- `frontend/src/components/Reminders.jsx`

**2. Your companies** — `frontend/src/data/companies.js` has 100 companies pre-loaded for a NYC CS student. Clear them out and add your own targets, or keep them as a starting point.

**3. Your NeetCode progress** — same file (`companies.js`), scroll to the `NEETCODE_150` export. It follows the official NeetCode 150 list with correct LeetCode problem numbers. Update each `status` field to reflect what you've already solved: `"not started"`, `"in progress"`, or `"mastered"`.

**4. Weekly email links** — `WeeklyDigestScheduler.java` has company links specific to my recruiting targets. Swap them for yours.

**5. Resend API key** — emails are sent via [Resend](https://resend.com) (free tier) instead of raw SMTP, because most hosts (Railway, Render, etc.) block outbound SMTP. Sign up with the email you want to send/receive from, grab an API key, and set it as `RESEND_API_KEY` in your environment.

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- Java 21
- Maven

### 1. Frontend
\`\`\`bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
\`\`\`
Opens at http://localhost:5173

### 2. Backend (Email via Resend)

1. Sign up at [resend.com](https://resend.com) using the email you want reminders sent from/to
2. Grab your API key from the dashboard
3. Set it as an environment variable:
\`\`\`bash
export RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_key_here
\`\`\`

**Run the backend:**
\`\`\`bash
cd backend
export JAVA_HOME=/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk@21
mvn spring-boot:run
\`\`\`
Runs on http://localhost:8080

### 3. Test it works
Visit http://localhost:8080/api/reminders/health → should return `{ "status": "CyrilHQ backend running ✅" }`

## Deploy to Vercel (Frontend)

\`\`\`bash
cd frontend
npm run build
\`\`\`
Push to GitHub → connect to Vercel → set **Root Directory** to `frontend` → deploy.

Set environment variable in Vercel (apply to all environments, including Production):
\`\`\`
VITE_BACKEND_URL=https://your-backend-url.com
\`\`\`

## Deploy Backend (Railway)

Push to GitHub → connect Railway → set **Root Directory** to `backend` → add environment variable:
\`\`\`
RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_key_here
\`\`\`
Railway auto-detects Maven and builds it. Note: Railway blocks outbound SMTP, which is exactly why this uses Resend's HTTP API instead of JavaMailSender.

---

## Data Persistence
All data (companies, notes, links, mood) is saved in **localStorage** — it persists across sessions in the same browser. No database required for the frontend.

Email scheduling uses an in-memory scheduler — scheduled reminders are lost if the backend restarts before they fire. Fine for a personal tool, not production-grade.
